    "BuyBot is your companion to challenge this behavior. Living right in your browser, it uses an LLM to make you pause and persuade: before you check out, you have to explain why you actually need the item. The model pushes back, asking questions about use, value, and alternatives (like a rational friend reminding you of your goals). You can even configure it to be as argumentative as you want!\n",
